I'm a heavy League player and often times I get ideas of fun themes for me and my friends to play this game differently, 
for example, catch the spy in a 5 v 5 match, or randomly assign a character to each player, etc.
This is a repo of those fun ideas, of how they are achieved in python code.

Idea 1. **Spy**: 
Randomly assign one spy in a five-player-team, without the host knowing who. Also avoid keep assigning spy to the same person in every five matches
so that everyone gets participation.
